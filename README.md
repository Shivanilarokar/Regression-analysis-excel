## Regression Model for ROI Prediction

I constructed a regression model using Excel's Regression Analysis tool to predict Return on Investment (ROI) based on the various factors mentioned above. The model provides insights into the collective impact of these factors on the financial success of movie projects.

## Visualization

To enhance the interpretability of the data, I utilized Excel's graph trendline feature to visually represent the relationships and trends identified through the regression model. This graphical representation facilitates a clearer understanding of the directional impact of each variable on the projected ROI.
